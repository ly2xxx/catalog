- **Tutorials** - Step-by-step guides for specific use cases
- **API Documentation** - Function and method documentation

### üíª Code Contributions
Direct code contributions to project repositories:

- **Bug Fixes** - Resolve existing issues and improve stability
- **Feature Implementation** - Add new functionality and capabilities
- **Performance Improvements** - Optimize existing code for better performance
- **Test Coverage** - Add tests to improve reliability and maintainability

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Before You Start

1. **Explore the Project** - Familiarize yourself with the codebase and documentation
2. **Check Existing Issues** - See if your idea or bug has already been reported
3. **Read the README** - Understand the project's purpose and setup requirements
4. **Review the Code** - Get a sense of the coding style and architecture

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

Most projects follow a similar setup pattern:

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub
# Clone your fork locally
git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git
cd project-name

# Add the original repository as upstream
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ly2xxx/project-name.git

# Create a virtual environment (for Python projects)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
# or for Node.js projects:
npm install

# Run tests to ensure everything works
python -m pytest  # or npm test
```

## üìã Contribution Process

### 1. Planning Your Contribution

Before starting work:

- **Open an Issue** - Discuss your planned changes if they're significant
- **Get Feedback** - Ensure your approach aligns with project goals
- **Check Dependencies** - Understand any requirements or constraints
- **Estimate Effort** - Have a realistic timeline for your contribution

### 2. Making Your Changes

Follow these best practices:

#### Code Quality Standards
```python
# Example Python code standards
def process_data(input_data: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> Dict[str, int]:
    """
    Process input data and return summary statistics.
    
    Args:
        input_data: List of dictionaries containing data to process
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary with summary statistics
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If input_data is empty or malformed
    """
    if not input_data:
        raise ValueError("Input data cannot be empty")
    
    # Implementation here
    return {"processed": len(input_data)}
```

#### Git Best Practices
```bash
# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Make atomic commits with clear messages
git commit -m "Add: New feature for data processing

- Implement data validation
- Add error handling for edge cases
- Include comprehensive tests"

# Keep your branch up to date
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
```

### 3. Testing Your Changes

Ensure your contribution is reliable:

#### Running Tests
```bash
# Run the full test suite
python -m pytest

# Run specific test categories
python -m pytest tests/unit/
python -m pytest tests/integration/

# Check test coverage
python -m pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html
```

#### Manual Testing
- **Functionality Testing** - Verify your changes work as expected
- **Edge Case Testing** - Test boundary conditions and error scenarios
- **Integration Testing** - Ensure your changes work with existing features
- **Performance Testing** - Check that performance isn't negatively impacted
